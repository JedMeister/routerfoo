System board: [APU4d4](https://www.pcengines.ch/apu4d4.htm) (â‚¬ 99) [schematics available](https://www.pcengines.ch/schema/apu4d.pdf)

- AMD Embedded G series GX-412TC
- 1GHz quad 64-bit Jaguar core (conductive cooling)
- BIOS based on [Coreboot](https://pcengines.github.io/)
- 4GB DDR3-1333 DRAM
- 4x gigabit Ethernet (Intel i211AT)
- DB9 serial, 2xUSB3.0, 2xUSB2.0, SD, SATA, GPIO, I2C
- 3x miniPCI express (mSATA, WiFi, SIM)

I use 120GB mSATA, WLE600VX WiFi (from pcengines, or eBay).
I might add a mobile data card + SIM later but those cards appear to be fairly costly.
