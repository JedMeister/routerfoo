## What are we trying to achieve?
- Learning experience
  - Exploring it all yourself adds perspective
  - Good testbed

- Improved yet maintainable security
  - Few tricks cover all scenarios
  - Does one trick catch lots? Great!
  - Looking which bits work, and overall effect
  - No single “this is right and that is wrong”
