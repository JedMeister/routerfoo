Geo-based WireGuardVPN using policy-based routing
by Arjen Lentz, arjen (at) lentz (dot) com (dot) au

Policy-based routing allows us to route all IP networks that 'belong' with a particular country across a specific interface.
You can use this if, for instance, you're an expat and you'd like to view TV in your country of origin.

Note:
Some adjustments may be required, because often these sites (also) use hosts elsewhere, not in that country.
So you'll need to go to the site without other things running, while monitoring your outbound traffic.
When you get a fail, you'll hopefully be able to spot which extra IPs/subnets you need to add to the party.
Please contribute them back here! One extra file per country, perhaps?

Policy-based routing in your tables:
-A PREROUTING -j mPOLROUTE
-A FORWARD -j mPOLROUTE
-A OUTPUT -j mPOLROUTE
-A mPOLROUTE -d <peer-pub-addr>/32 -j RETURN
-A mPOLROUTE -m set --match-set <country-net-list> dst -j MARK --set-xmark 0xc21/0xffffffff
-A mPOLROUTE -j RETURN

You may need some or all of the below in /etc/rc.local to have it come up at boot time
Not all of the below may be required any more, WG has become ever smarter.
Check the output when you do the wg-quick up, WG will show what things it sets based on your config!
And yes, it'll do the same when you issue the 'down' command for a WG interface.

Note that the 3105 (decimal) matches up with the 0xc21 (hex) above. You can use another number.
# systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
# ip route add <server-pvt-addr> dev wg0
# ip route add table wg.some.country default via <server-pvt-addr> dev wg0
# ip rule add priority 1000 from all fwmark 3105 lookup wg.some.country
# ip rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0
# ip route flush cache
